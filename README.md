Kantar Conding Challenge

This challenge took longer than the 2h time limit.

Even with that, there are some issues that need fixing:
- DiscountService is not fully on par with SRP
- ItemMappingFactory is using hardcoded string on switch case
- ItemRepository is using hardcoded mock database
- ItemType is not used as initially intended
- Only added one unit test (on Application layer)

Among other issues

IÂ´ve published locally a build version for direct ease of use only, hence the "Published Version" folder.

Regardless of the outcome, this was fun :)
